This is the second file for practicing GitHub. 

Here are some useful commands used when removing the duplicate file: 
    rm firstfile
    git add firstfile
    git commit -m "Remove duplicate file"
    git push

For a new file locally, the steps to upload it to GitHub are:
    git add <filename>
    git commit -m "Add <filename>
    git push
    
More practice is still needed.
